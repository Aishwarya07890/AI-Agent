# AI-Agent

So, I will start with a simple main script. I will create a file for actions and a file for prompts. The AI agent is mainly a combination of external functions and a special prompt. In the actions, I will define a simple action. This is like a tool that the AI can use. This is a very basic function that you give it a URL, and based on the URL, it will return a specific response time. Again, this is very basic to understand the concept. In the next example, we will move into a real-world AI agent and see the magical power of AI agents. Please follow along now to understand the concept.
So, we defined an action for this AI agent. Then, in the prompt section, we will define the AI agent system prompt. This system prompt is the main and core of the AI agent. This is what makes the agent mimic human behavior. So, please focus very well on this part. If you get it, you can build any agent you want. So, let’s see the prompt.
And here we are, "Please focus for 10 seconds. You run in a loop of thought, action, pause, and action response." We are telling the language model that it will enter a loop of thought and action, and action response. Look at this: use thought to understand the question you’ve been asked. The thought to understand the user’s question, the action to run one of the actions available to you, and the action response will be the result of running those actions. Then, you tell the model what actions are available—what tools the agent will have. So, in our case, in this basic example, we have this function, "get_response_time," that we defined here, this action. So now the language model can call this function or have the capability of calling this function.
I will show an example. The function with the parameter name will return the response time. So, this is the description of the action. And then, and this is very important, I will give the AI an example session of how it will work. For example, if I ask it, "What is the response time for my website?" First, it will generate a thought. It will think about it. "I should check the response time for the webpage first." This is how you think. If I ask you now, "What is the response time of my website?" First, you will go and use a tool to check the response time. This is what the AI agent is doing now. It thought about it, and now it will pick an action. So, it picks an action and returns it in JSON format in this structured format. You’ll see a little bit, but in short, this JSON will be returned in our code, so we can call the function easily. We can access JSON easily. Then, it will be called again with the action response. It got the response from the action. Now it can use it to generate the final answer, "The response time for Google is 0.2 seconds."
In short, the agent here, what I’m telling the agent is to think about the question and pick a tool that can help in answering the question. It will call the function, return the result, and combine it with the question to generate the full answer. I hope you got the idea. It’s somehow simple, and now you can play with this prompt based on your case scenario.
So, this is the system prompt that we will use in our model. This is what we call the react prompt, where the model can think and react based on that thought and take actions based on that thought. Anyway, this is somehow related to prompt engineering. If you are following my other videos, you may have passed by this topic. So, this is a system prompt that we are going to use with our model.
Perfect! Now we have the actions, we have the prompt that will power our agent, and we’re ready to put things together and create our simple agent.
Okay, so let’s open a new terminal and get started. Create a new virtual environment. Let’s activate it. Perfect! Now, since we are building an AI agent, we need to power it with AI, so I’ll be using OpenAI API. Let’s install OpenAI: pip install openai. I will keep all the code in just one script to make things simple for you, and I’ll write the code in a very basic way for beginners. And don’t forget, if you have any problems, don’t forget to join us on the forum on my website. I’ll be there almost every day with the team, with thousands of people, to engage and learn together.
So, we installed OpenAI. Let’s create a new environmental file to save the OpenAI API key. Save it. Go back here, and simply now import OpenAI, and load the environmental variables. Just create an OpenAI client with the API key. And I created this simple function that generates text based on messages. Simply, I’m calling the API OpenAI and returning back the response. Very basic, simple function. And here you can pass the model.
So now we have the function that calls OpenAI. We will use it to build the agent. First, we define the available functions for this AI agent so it can pick one. Then, we call the system prompt and create the agent loop. So, it works like this: whenever I pass a question, it will generate a response. But first, it needs to check if it can do something to solve this problem. Then, it will call one of the actions and return the response. Simple as that.
Perfect! So we have everything set up. Now you can try it. And trust me, you’ll be amazed by how simple it is to create such an AI agent. Once you master this loop, you can create any agent you want.
